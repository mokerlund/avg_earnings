# avg_earnings
The averages of my earnings from a year's worth of data and projected earnings for the next three months.

I took the data from all of the logged days from 2016 March - December.
This includes the gross tips and salary as well as the days of the week.

The exact data I'm looking for is: average total salary, average total tips,  average total hours, average salary per day of the week, average tips per day of the week, average hours per day of the week, overall total earned, projected total earnings from working Sunday and Tuesday every week for 3 months.
